ESP32 Multitasking - More M5Stack ATOM Matrix microBlocks Examples.
Comments from my last video "ESP32 Multitasking - Is It Possible? microBlocks with M5Stack ATOM Matrix" made me want to try this again. It has been on the back of my mind to revisit this topic with a concrete example. A friend of the channel offers some great ideas. I do my best to illustrate those here. I even try progamming the ATOM Matrix in the Arduino IDE for the first time.
